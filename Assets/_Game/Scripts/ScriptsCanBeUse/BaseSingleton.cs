/*
If a critical section spans an entire method, the locking facility can be achieved by placing the System.
Runtime.CompilerServices.MethodImplAttribute on the method, and specifying the Synchronized value in the constructor of 
System.Runtime.CompilerServices.MethodImplAttribute. When you use this attribute, the Enter and Exit method calls are not needed. 
The following code fragment illustrates this pattern:

C#

Copy
[MethodImplAttribute(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized)]
void MethodToLock()
{
   // Method implementation.
} 

Note that the attribute causes the current thread to hold the lock until the method returns; if the lock can be released sooner, 
use the Monitor class, the C# lock statement, or the Visual Basic SyncLock statement inside of the method instead of the attribute.

While it is possible for the Enter and Exit statements that lock and release a given object to cross member or class boundaries or both, 
this practice is not recommended.
